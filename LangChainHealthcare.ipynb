            "* **Asthma Exacerbation:** If the patient has a history of asthma, these symptoms could indicate a worsening of their condition.  The shortness of breath, especially with exertion, is a key indicator.  A cough may be present, and mild chest tightness or pain can also occur.\n",
            "* **Possible early signs of COVID-19:** Although less common now, it's worth considering as COVID-19 can present with a persistent cough, low-grade fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath.\n",

            "* **Possible tests:** The doctor may order a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia or other lung conditions, blood tests to check for infection, or a pulmonary function test (PFT) if asthma is suspected.  They may also consider a COVID test depending on local prevalence and guidelines.\n",
            "* **Rest and hydration:** In the meantime, focus on rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid irritants such as smoke or dust.  Over-the-counter pain relievers (like acetaminophen) can help manage fever and discomfort, but consult your physician before use.  Do not attempt to self-treat without professional guidance.\n",
