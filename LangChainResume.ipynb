            "\n",
            "John Doe's resume shows potential but needs significant improvement to effectively target software engineering or data science roles.  Let's break down the needed changes:\n",
            "\n",
            "**1. Structure & Formatting:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Resume Length:**  For someone with a few years of experience, this resume is too short.  More detail is needed to demonstrate accomplishments and impact.\n",
            "* **Summary vs. Profile:** The \"Summary\" is weak.  Replace it with a compelling \"Professional Profile\" or \"Summary of Qualifications\" that highlights key achievements and quantifiable results (e.g., \"Reduced API latency by 15% through optimization of database queries\").  This should be tailored to the specific job being applied for.\n",
            "* **Experience Section:**  This is far too brief.  Each bullet point needs to be expanded using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result). Quantify accomplishments whenever possible. Instead of \"Built REST APIs using Flask and PostgreSQL,\" write something like \"Designed and implemented 5 REST APIs using Flask and PostgreSQL, resulting in a 20% increase in data processing efficiency.\"\n",
            "* **Skills Section:** The skills section is okay but could be categorized for better readability and impact.  Group skills by category (e.g., Programming Languages, Databases, Cloud Platforms, DevOps Tools). Consider adding skills relevant to the specific job application.\n",
            "* **Keywords:** Incorporate keywords relevant to the target job description.  Analyze job postings for common terms and strategically incorporate them.\n",
            "* **Formatting:** Use consistent formatting (bullet points, spacing, font).  Consider using a professional resume template to improve visual appeal.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Skills (Missing or Outdated):**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Cloud Platforms:**  Familiarity with AWS, Azure, or GCP is crucial in many software engineering and data science roles.  Add any relevant experience.\n",
            "* **Data Structures and Algorithms:**  This is fundamental for software engineering and especially data science.  Mention proficiency if applicable.\n",
            "* **Testing Frameworks:** Include experience with testing frameworks (e.g., pytest, Jest, Selenium) if you have any.\n",
            "* **Databases (Beyond SQL):**  Mention NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) if you have experience.\n",
            "* **Big Data Technologies:**  For data science roles, include skills like Spark, Hadoop, or other big data processing tools if relevant.\n",
            "* **Data Visualization:**  If aiming for data science, add libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Tableau.\n",
            "* **Version Control (beyond Git):** While Git is essential, mention specific branching strategies (e.g., Gitflow) if used.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Language (Tone, Clarity):**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Stronger Verbs:** Use stronger action verbs to describe accomplishments (e.g., \"designed,\" \"implemented,\" \"optimized,\" \"led,\" \"managed\").\n",
            "* **Quantifiable Results:**  Always quantify your accomplishments whenever possible.  Use numbers and metrics to demonstrate impact.\n",
            "* **Conciseness:**  Avoid jargon and keep the language clear and concise.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Job Alignment (Software Engineering/Data Science):**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Specificity:** The current resume is too generic.  Tailor it to each specific job application. Highlight skills and experiences most relevant to the job description.\n",
            "* **Data Science:**  If aiming for a data science role, emphasize statistical modeling, machine learning algorithms, and data analysis skills.  Show evidence of projects or work experience involving these.\n",
            "* **Software Engineering:**  For software engineering, focus on software development lifecycle (SDLC) experience, architectural design, and problem-solving skills.  Showcase contributions to large-scale projects.\n",
            "* **Projects:** Add a \"Projects\" section to showcase personal projects that demonstrate your skills and abilities.  This is especially valuable for showcasing unique capabilities.\n",
